## 🚀 Starting a New Google Apps Script Project

Now that all tools are installed, here's how to start ANY new project:

---

### STEP 10: Choose Your Starting Point

#### Option A: Start from Scratch (New Project)

**IMPORTANT: Where to Create Your Project Folder**

**Local Machine Storage** (Recommended):
- ✅ **Use this if**: Working from one computer, or no VPN required
- ✅ **Pros**: Faster, no network delays, works offline
- ✅ **Location**: `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\Projects`

**Network/Shared Drive** (VPN Required):
- ⚠️ **Use this if**: Need to access from multiple locations via VPN
- ⚠️ **Cons**: Slower, requires VPN connection every time, network dependency
- ⚠️ **Location**: Your mapped network drive (e.g., `Z:\Projects`)
- ⚠️ **Note**: You MUST connect to VPN before opening VS Code or running any commands

**Which should you choose?**
- **Most people**: Use local machine (C: drive)
- **Team environments**: Use network drive only if you must access from multiple offices

1. Create a project folder:
```powershell
# LOCAL MACHINE (Recommended)
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
mkdir Projects
cd Projects
mkdir MyGoogleSheetsProject
cd MyGoogleSheetsProject

# OR NETWORK DRIVE (if VPN required)
# Make sure you're connected to VPN first!
cd Z:\Projects  # Replace Z: with your network drive letter
mkdir MyGoogleSheetsProject
cd MyGoogleSheetsProject
```

2. Initialize Git:
```powershell
git init
```

3. Create a new Apps Script project:
```powershell
clasp create --title "My Project Name" --type standalone
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a new Apps Script project in your Google Drive
- Creates `.clasp.json` file (links your folder to the script)
- Creates `appsscript.json` file (configuration)

4. Create your first script file:
   - In VS Code: File → New File
   - Save as `Code.gs`
   - Start coding!

**✅ Checkpoint**: You have `.clasp.json` and can run `clasp push`

---

#### Option B: Clone an Existing Project from GitHub

**If someone shared a project with you:**

1. Navigate to your projects folder:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
```

2. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
cd REPOSITORY-NAME
```

**Replace with actual GitHub URL** (example):
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bkaufman7/END-OF-MONTH-CM360-CPC-CPM-FLIGHT-QA---VSCODE-VERSION.git
cd "CM360 END OF MONTH AUDIT"
```

3. Link to YOUR Apps Script project (see Step 11)

**✅ Checkpoint**: Repository files are on your computer

---

### STEP 11: Link to Your Google Apps Script Project

#### If Linking to an EXISTING Apps Script Project:

**Get your Script ID:**
1. Open your Google Spreadsheet
2. Click **Extensions → Apps Script**
3. In the Apps Script editor, click the **Settings** (gear) icon
4. Copy the **Script ID**

**Create `.clasp.json` file:**

In PowerShell (make sure you're in your project folder):
```powershell
# Replace YOUR_SCRIPT_ID with the ID you copied
# Replace the path with your actual project path

$claspConfig = @"
{
  "scriptId": "YOUR_SCRIPT_ID_HERE"
}
"@

$claspConfig | Out-File -FilePath .clasp.json -Encoding utf8
```

**Example** (with real values):
```powershell
$claspConfig = @"
{
  "scriptId": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j"
}
"@

$claspConfig | Out-File -FilePath .clasp.json -Encoding utf8
```

**✅ Checkpoint**: `.clasp.json` file exists in your project folder

---

### STEP 12: Open Project in VS Code

```powershell
# Open current folder in VS Code
code .
```

VS Code will open with your project files visible on the left.

**✅ Checkpoint**: You see your project files in VS Code's Explorer pane

---

### STEP 13: Push Code to Apps Script

**In VS Code terminal** (or PowerShell in your project folder):

```powershell
clasp push
```

**What happens:**
- VS Code sends your `.gs` files to Google Apps Script
- You'll see a list of files pushed

Expected output:
```
Pushed 2 files.
└─ appsscript.json
└─ Code.gs
```

**✅ Checkpoint**: Files pushed without errors

---

### STEP 14: Verify in Apps Script Web Editor

```powershell
# Open your project in browser
clasp open
```

**You should see:**
- Your code files in the Apps Script editor
- Same code as in VS Code

**✅ Checkpoint**: Code appears in Apps Script editor

---

### STEP 15: Bind Script to a Google Spreadsheet (If Needed)

**If you want your script to work with a specific Google Sheet:**

1. Open your Google Spreadsheet
2. Click **Extensions → Apps Script**
3. Delete any existing code
4. Go back to PowerShell and run:
```powershell
clasp push
```
5. Refresh your spreadsheet
6. The custom menu should appear (if your code has `onOpen()` function)

**✅ Checkpoint**: Custom menu appears in your spreadsheet

---

### STEP 16: Set Up GitHub Repository (Version Control)

**Why?** Save your code online and track changes.

#### Create a New Repository on GitHub:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon (top-right) → **"New repository"**
3. Name your repository (e.g., "my-google-sheets-automation")
4. Choose **Private** or **Public**
5. **Do NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have files)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

#### Connect Your Local Project to GitHub:

GitHub will show you commands. Copy them, or use these:

```powershell
# Add GitHub as the remote repository (replace with YOUR repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Add all files to git
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example** (with real values):
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/my-sheets-project.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

**You'll be asked for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password!)

**How to create a Personal Access Token:**
1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Check "repo" scope
4. Copy the token and save it somewhere safe
5. Use this token as your password

**✅ Checkpoint**: Your code is visible on GitHub.com

## 📁 Typical Project File Structure

After complete setup:

```
YourProjectFolder/
├── .clasp.json                    # Links to your Apps Script project (DON'T commit to Git)
├── .claspignore                   # Files to ignore when pushing to Apps Script
├── .git/                          # Git repository data
├── .gitignore                     # Files to ignore in Git
├── appsscript.json                # Apps Script configuration
├── Code.gs                        # Your main script file
├── OtherFile.gs                   # Additional script files (optional)
└── README.md                      # Project documentation
```

**Important files explained:**

- **`.clasp.json`**: Links your folder to your Google Apps Script project. **Never commit this to Git!** (Has your Script ID)
- **`.gitignore`**: Tells Git which files to ignore (like `.clasp.json`)
- **`appsscript.json`**: Configuration for your Apps Script project (timezone, API services, etc.)
- **`Code.gs`**: Your actual script code (can have multiple `.gs` files)

---

## 🔄 Daily Development Workflow

**Once everything is set up, here's your daily workflow:**

### Making Changes to Your Code

1. **Open your project in VS Code**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\YourProject

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### Critical: Files to NEVER Commit to GitHub

**Your `.gitignore` file should include:**

```gitignore
# clasp authentication (has your Script ID!)
.clasp.json
.clasprc.json

# Node modules
node_modules/

# Environment variables (passwords, API keys)
.env

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

**Why?**
- `.clasp.json` contains your Script ID (could expose your project)
- `.env` might contain passwords or API keys
- Committing these = security risk!

### Create a `.gitignore` File:

In your project folder:

```powershell
$gitignore = @"
# clasp authentication
.clasp.json
.clasprc.json

# Node modules
node_modules/

# Environment variables
.env

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
"@

$gitignore | Out-File -FilePath .gitignore -Encoding utf8
```

**✅ Verify**: `.gitignore` file exists before your first `git commit`

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 😕 "I can't push to Apps Script" - Authentication Error

**Problem**: `clasp push` says "Not authorized" or "Login required"

**Solution**:
```powershell
clasp logout
clasp login
```
Then try `clasp push` again.

---

### 😕 "No files to push" Error

**Problem**: `clasp push` says "No files to push"

**Fix 1 - Check if `.claspignore` exists:**

If you have a `.claspignore` file, it should look like:
```
**/**
!appsscript.json
!**/*.gs
```

**Fix 2 - Make sure you have `.gs` files:**

Your project needs at least one `.gs` file (e.g., `Code.gs`)

---

### 😕 "Changes don't appear in my spreadsheet"

**Problem**: You pushed code but the spreadsheet doesn't reflect changes

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Did you run `clasp push`?
2. ✅ Did it say "Pushed X files"?
3. ✅ Refresh your spreadsheet (press `F5`)
4. ✅ Wait 10 seconds (sometimes takes a moment)
5. ✅ Check Apps Script editor: `clasp open`

If menu doesn't appear:
- Make sure your code has an `onOpen()` function
- Close and reopen the spreadsheet
- Check Executions log in Apps Script for errors

---

### 😕 "Git push failed" - Authentication Error

**Problem**: `git push` asks for password but it's rejected

**Solution**: You need a **Personal Access Token**, not your password!

**Create a token:**
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
3. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
4. Check "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when `git push` asks

**Save credentials** (so you don't have to enter every time):
```powershell
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

---

### 😕 "Permission denied" or "Forbidden"

**Problem**: Can't access spreadsheet or Apps Script

**Cause**: You're using the wrong Google account

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're logged into the correct Google account in your browser
2. Logout and login to clasp with the RIGHT account:
   ```powershell
   clasp logout
   clasp login
   ```
3. Choose the account that owns the spreadsheet

---

### 😕 "Script ID not found"

**Problem**: `.clasp.json` has wrong Script ID

**Fix**:
1. Open your spreadsheet
2. Extensions → Apps Script
3. Click Settings (gear icon)
4. Copy the Script ID
5. Update `.clasp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scriptId": "PASTE_CORRECT_ID_HERE"
   }
   ```

---

### 😕 "Copilot isn't suggesting anything"

**Problem**: Copilot installed but not working

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Are you signed into GitHub in VS Code?
   - Click Copilot icon in status bar
2. ✅ Do you have an active Copilot subscription?
   - Check [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
3. ✅ Is Copilot enabled for this file type?
   - `.gs` files should work
4. ✅ Try restarting VS Code

---

### 😕 "Command not found: clasp" or "Command not found: git"

**Problem**: Installed but terminal doesn't recognize commands

**Solution**:
1. **Close and reopen PowerShell** (very important!)
2. If still not working, restart your computer
3. Verify installation:
   ```powershell
   node --version
   npm --version
   git --version
   clasp --version
   ```

---

### 😕 "How do I enable Gmail/Drive APIs?"

**Problem**: Your script needs to access Gmail or Drive

**Solution**:
